# RestaurantApp
 This  project is idea to consolidate Core Java + OOPs + Collection Framework concepts into one solid console-based Restaurant Management System.
Let’s break it down fully — I’ll give you:
1.	✅ Problem statement
2.	🎯 Objectives & Scope
3.	🧱 Core OOP Classes (with relationships)
4.	💡 List of 10+ Features
5.	🧩 Suggested Technologies/Concepts to Apply
6.	🖥️ Program Flow (User and Owner flow)
7.	🧾 Sample Output
8.	💻 Implementation Plan (Step-by-step)

✅ 1. Problem Statement
Design and develop a console-based Restaurant Management System in Core Java using OOP principles and Java Collection Framework.
The system should allow customers to register, view the menu, place orders, and generate bills.
The restaurant owner should be able to view customers, manage menus, and view sales reports.
This application will simulate the basic workflow of a restaurant — menu browsing, ordering, billing, and customer management — all from the command line.

🎯 2. Objectives & Scope
•	To apply OOP principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
•	To use Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedHashMap, etc.) for data storage and manipulation.
•	To simulate real-world restaurant operations in a console environment.
•	To allow role-based actions (Customer vs Owner) through a menu-driven interface.
